# surfs_up (Analysis)
Intro to SQLite, SQLalchemy, and Flask

## Overview
### Purpose and Background
This served as an introductory example analysis for using SQLite and SQLalchemy in real practice. My task was to find the best month to open a surf shop in Hawaii. By analyzing historic temperature data from nine active weather stations in the area, a statistically "safer" decision was made possible for the business owner.

### Method and Results
A SQLite database consisting of two tables already existed. The *'measurement'* table contained the columns: id, station, date, prcp, and tobs. These abbreviations describe columns for **row index**, **station id** where row data was collected, **date** on which row data was collected, **precipitation data* in inches, and **observed temperature** data in Farenheit. The *'station'* table contained the columns: id, station, name, latitude, longitude, and elevation. The names of each station used in this analysis are listed below:

#### Deliverable 1: Number of Retiring Employees by Title

The first step in creating this table was to find all current employees within a specific age range. While I do not know what year this data is actually from, the desired birth-dates were between January 1st, 1952 and December 31st, 1955. The marker for current-employees was a *to_date* of 'January 1st, 9999'. I combined the name and employee number data from the **employees.csv** dataset with the position title and position-related start and finish dates frm the **titles.csv** dataset. Since many employees had mutliple tenures in their history, I then filterd all repeating employee numbers by ordering by employee number AND end_date (descending). Then, using **DISTINCT ON (emp_no)**, I selected the first listed row (moost recent end-date) for each grouping of employee positions. Then I filtered the selected values by only allowing finish dates = 01-01-9999 into the new table. This table was saved as **unique_titles.csv** and is shown below:

  </p>
  
- This table simplifies the connection between current employees and their position significantly.
- This still returns a very long list.
  
The final step for fulfilling this deliverable was to create a new table that displayed the number of employees in the retirement age-range for each listed position in the company. I used **COUNT(title)** to get a numerical representaion of each person sharing each unique company title, and I selected title to get the character value of each position. I then grouped the table by the positions' character values to created the following table, saved as **retiring_titles.csv**):

  </p>
  
- It is evident that a large amount of Senior Engineer and Senior Staff will be lost soon, 
- Very few management positions will be left empty.

#### Deliverable 2: Eligible Employees for the Mentorship Program

For this task, I combined the employee number, name, and birth-date data from the **employees.csv** dataset, the position-related start and finish dates from the **dept_emp.csv** dataset, and the position titles from the **titles.csv** dataset. I then filtered out all non-employed persons outside of another desired age-range of January 1st, 1965 to Decemeber 31st, 1965 using the **WHERE-AND** operation. I then ordered by employee number to get the following table, saved as **mentorship_eligibility.csv**:

<p align="center">
  <img width=auto height="500" src=Resources/Images/eligile_emp.png>
  </p>
  
- This draws clear connections between age, and tenure.
- The table is still quite long, despite filtering out non-current employees.
- All columns are helpful in deciding eligilibity.
- The date format is organized better, but is still a little awkward to interpret.

### Conclusion
Based on the table in Deliverable 2, it appears as though a litle over 72,000 positions will need to be filled in the years to come. This is a lot of employees to train, but luckily there are quite a few mentor-eligible employees for most position types. I made the following table to display this:

  <img width=auto height="500" src=Resources/Images/mentor_counts.png>
  </p>
  
So now we know just how many potential mentors exist in each area of the company, and since it's pretty easy to see that these numbers don't add up to 72,000 we'll need another table to better visualize the vacancy-mentor disparity. I went ahead and made one using the previous table and the **retiring_titles** table from Deliverable 2:

  </p>
  
Now we're talking. Not only do we now see that there are zero potential mentors for mangement positions, we can easily see which positions will provide the largest mentor pools for new employees based on the position-mentor ratio. It's not looking good for the senior engineer mentors. This may push hiring managers to temporarily seek engineers with more experience than what has been required in the past. Fortunately, there will only two management vacancies to fill!
